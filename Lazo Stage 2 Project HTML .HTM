<p> Web development, we are going to build a web blog that will be <b>online</b>.
  
<br>
We may even have it reference 
<a href="www.udacity.com">active web pages</a>.

</div>

<div>

<p>I may begin a blog about scuba diving and may chose to add some images <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Buzo.jpg/300px-Buzo.jpg" alt="img">
 I may want to add some of my own stories of the dives that I do and share my experiences as to who my dive buddy was and where we were.
  
<br>
 
 <br>

<p>I can also add some stories that my dive buddies have shared with me with their experiences and where we might go in the future.

<h2 class="title">Lesson 2</h2>

<div class="description2"> HTML is HyperText Markup Language.  It's a computer Language that web browsers are able to interpret when creating web pages.  There are certain elements called tags which are enclosed by the less than and greater than symbols that create the syntax that web browsers use.  The tags don’t display on the webpages but aid to the formatting process. 
<br> 
<br>
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets.  These create the styling of the web page as in the background color and the font size to name a couple examples.  Prior to CSS that was contained in the HTML.  Now with CSS the styling can be controlled in an efficient manner.   You can control the entire page with simple commands from the CSS.
</div> 
<br>
<div class="description"> 
Giving a class and value to a tag just helps to define the tag as you go along.  It doesn't display this information on the web page itself.</div>
 <br>
 Using div <div>simply puts a box around the area you are working with</div>

<br>
It doesn't show that box on the web page itself.

<br>

<br>
I have downloaded <b>Sublime Text 2</b> to my computer as part of the course instructions.

<br>

<br>

The tag element span is <span style="background: yellow">another element that doesn't show on the web page itself and I'm not too clear on what it actually does.  It's similar to div in the way that it categorizes the part of the page.  The differenc is that span only boxes the lines attached. You can see that with the background color on these lines of text.  Span is putting a box around these lines as I type and the highlight color only stays on the lines of text that I'm typing.  That is the difference between span and div.  You will see later how Div puts the box around the text but the box is from the left side of the page all the way to the right side of the page</span>.

 <br>

<br>

<br>
  
<div style="background: pink">Div puts a box around everything that is contained within it's perameters that streatches to both sides of the page as you see here. As I keep typing and adding to the lines the box within div is going to continue to grow and if my line stops in the middle of the page the background color should continue to the right side of the page.</div>

<br>
      
<br>
      
<div class="CSS"> I just used two void tags br to add to lines/breaks in the text to start a new paragraph.  I guess I should have used p for that but I want to see what this does to my document.  This part is going to be using the comands in the css-cascading style sheets to change the styling from here on out.  I've already been experimenting by making the background of the document orange.  I may have to rethink that color after looking at this for a while.  I did change the background color to gray because the orange was beginning to get too harsh looking at it for longs periods of time.  It's interesting I was trying to figure out why the background color wasn't changing to white like I had it in my css style sheet and I finally realized it was because I spelt bacground without the k.  Once I spelled background correctly the color changed to white.  So I will need to be careful with my spelling.  Too bad the text editors didn't have auto correct in them</div>. 
      
<p>
        
<div class="observation">
        Now I am going to use P to create a new paragraph.  That automatically added spaces between my last line of text and this paragraph I'm typing now.  I will probably get points taken off because I am actually typing my notes out as text and thoughts.  But I want to get the feel for what my web page is going to look like and I'm not putting in every little detail of my notes.  I have looked at some of the other students codepen notes and realize mine is totally different.  You teachers reading this, I hope you like my style and will understand what it is that I'm doing.  This is the way that I am going to learn how to do this, plug for me.  Now I want to play with the font size and style for this section so I am going to add font-size= 15 and font-weight=bold to my css style sheet.  Here goes.  Let's see if this works. Apparently what I've put in the css is not working and i'm not sure on why.  It worked when I changed the font size to 17. I think the default font is 14 so it really didn't look different when changed the font to 15 so I changed it to 17 and it worked.  I had to change the description to font-weight which is when the text finally changed to bold.</div>
<br>      
<br>      
<div class="boxes"> This section is going to be fun, but I would like to be able to size the boxes in the css portion.  I've been going over this section and I'm still trying to figure it out.  I'm still a bit confused on how it works. I worked on this on Sunday 2/15 and when I was working on the boxes in codepen with the .css for .boxes, I was changing the px's and the box didn't change.  I got into this today 2/16 and I notice that the box was created and began testing the px's.  I notice that when I change the px's and save nothing changes until I get out of the profile and get back in.  Once I get back in the box size changes.  I found this site very helpful to understand how boxes are created <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">active web pages</a></div>	

<h3>Stage 2</h3>
  <div class="description2"> The beginning of Stage 2 we are introduced to the Python language that we are going to start using.
    <br>
    A program is just instructions to tell a computer what to do.  We develop a computer language because our English language is ambiguous.  The same word can have multiple meanings.  A computer language needs to be specific so it can tell the computer what to do.  With a language you only need a limited amount of code to get the computer to perform a complicated process.  The best way to learn a language is to try things.
    <br>
    Python is an interpreter that takes the program language and changes it into the language that the computer can understand.
    <br>
    The syntax needs to be exact for python to work.  So there is an element of grammar related to Python.   This is the grammar for an Arithmetic Expression.
    <br>
    <br>

Expression :  Expression Operator Expression
    <br>
Expression :  Number
    <br>
Operator: +, *
    <br>
    You can also take any expression and put (parenthesis) around it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The most important topic in all of programming is the variable.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can assign Variables with a name.  You can write an assignment statement and give a name to an expression.
    <br>
Name = expression
    <br>
Speed_of_light= 299792458
<br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind is that the = sign doesn’t mean equals in Python.    = 
It means assign the value on the right side of the equal sign to the left value of the equal sign.</div>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
    <h2>Functions</H2>
    <div class="description2"> We have learned about Functions yet Dave called them Procedures.  A function defines elements called inputs and massages that to become output.  </div>
<br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h2>The Differnce Between Making and Using a Function</h2>
    <div class="description2">
      When you make a function you are building the elements by defining, using def, what the inputs are going to be and how those inputs are going to return a result.
<div class=boxes>def abbaize(a,b):
  <br>
  return a+b+b+a</div>
      This defines abbaize as two inputs a and b and it will create one output that shows a followed by b followed by b again followed by a.
      <br>
      <br>
      To Use this function we then use 
      <div class=boxes>
        print ('dog','cat')
        <br>
        and that returns dogcatcatdog</div>
    </div>
    <h2>Functions Help Avoid Repetition</h2>
   <div class=description2> Once you have defined a function you can use it with different variables.  
     <br>
     <div class=boxes>
        print ('a','b')
        <br>
        and that returns abba</div>
     I wanted the same output, just with differnt variables so all I need to do is change the print statement which then changes my variables.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>When a function Doesn't Have a Return Statement</h2>
    <br>
    <div class=description2>A function always needs a return statement to produce a result.  Here is an example of what happens when a Function doesn't have a return statement.
      <div class=boxes>def abbaize(a,b):<br>
        answer= a+b+b+a<br>
        print abbaize('dog','cat')
      The result for this will be "None"</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>If Statements and While Loops</h2>
    <div class= description2>I've decided I’m giving you my feedback here while I’m going through this course.  I just read through the page of Where to focus your attention and it says the first lesson is about if statements and the second part is about while loops.  Then I go to the next page and it’s the python interpreter with examples  asking what is going to happen when you run the while loops?  How am I supposed to come up with an idea of what is going to happen when I don’t know what a while loops is?  That’s not hard, it’s illogical to me.  If you don’t want to totally confuse people, wouldn’t it be more educational to explain what these elements are before you supply examples?  I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm trying to give you constructive criticism from a 53 year old who has basic computer knowlege, trying to learn new skills to keep myself employed for the next 12 to 17 years. <a href="http://www.freesmileys.org/smileys.php" title="Smiley"><img src="http://www.freesmileys.org/smileys/smiley-angelic002.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /></a>!!
      <br>
      <br>
    I will tell you that this was the most difficult section of this course so far for me and very discouraging.  I was beginning to think I should end this Nano Degree.  I know your response will be I should post things to the forum and collaborate with my other cohorts.  The problem is that when I don’t understand something I need to talk to someone to help me figure things out.  Posting an issue on the forum isn’t going to help me because if I can talk to someone and show them what I’m doing I can learn what mistakes I’m making.
      <br>
      <br>
You may notice the blue boxes in my previous section.  I actually learned that from going to a web site that Eric had posted in the forum weeks ago.  I’ve been going to Code Academy to learn some of the HTML and I found a web site that gave me clearer information on how to use CSS style sheets.  
<br>
      <br>
I don’t plan on giving up on this, but I find it very disheartening that I have to go to outside sources to learn the information that I am being asked to learn, while I am paying Udacity to teach me.  I’ve questioned, Will This “Nano Degree” add value to my resume?  I’m actually just trying to stay employed with ATT for the next 12 – 17 years because at my age, it will be difficult to find a job making the salary that I currently make.
<br>
      <br>
   One other observation is that I believe there are people taking this class that have a lot of experience with other Program languages, so they would already be programmers in my book.  That is why I won’t share my website with anyone on the forums.  I’m not confident enough with my knowledge of what I’m doing, yet.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have learned that Python is Very sensitive to how the syntax is positioned.  I have taught myself SQL over the years and I still am trying to learn all the syntax for that.  SQL seems to be a bit lenient on where things are placed.  I have been getting Indent Errors as I try to write the If and While statements.
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class=boxes2><em>If Statements</em> allow you to compare multiple variables.  For instance, you can determine what is the bigger number of two numbers.  You can even determine what is the Biggest number of a few numbers.
      <br>
      <br>
      <em>While Statements</em> allow you to add continous functions within the code.  With a simple statement you can tell the computer to list the numbers from 0 to 10.  You can also write code that tells the computer to keep adding numbers to infinity as long as the computer has the power and memory to do so.</div>
      <h2>Using the Python Language</h2>
      This may be the end for me.  I have had the hardest time with this section trying to learn the Python Language.  I have searched topics on Google to obtain some of the answers. I even started going through a Tutorial on Code Academy (for free), to attempt to learn the syntax needed for using Python.  There are times when I have a question on things I actually need to talk to a human being.  I posted something on the discussion boards once and was interacting with a nice guy from Udacity, but even he couldn't understand what I was trying to do and to continue writing back and forth on the dicussion board was not working for me.  I don't know if I'm going to pass this Project or not, if I do I may attempt to continue with the program, but if this is supposed to continue to build on utalizing the Python Language I will probably end this.  I may attempt to use the sources that I've found in Code Academy and maybe even Udemy.  I just cant justify paying for this Nano degree when I am having to go to free sources to learn what it is that I need to know to pass the projects.
      <br>
      <br>
      I think I have a good grasp on how to work with HTML and CSS.  Which I actually find to be fun.  When you through Python into the mix it brings a negative element in for me.  Sorry,</div> 
      <br>

      <h1>Statistics I'd love to know</h1>
      <div class=description2>
      I would love to know how many people signed up for this Intro to Programing class?
        <br>
        <br>
        How many already have knowledge of another Program Language?
        <br>
        <br>
        How many were taking this so they could post on their Resume they have this nano degree?
        <br>
        <br>
        How many were like me, i.e. I have never written code before and never worked with HTML and CSS.  
        <br>
        <br>
        I know there was a guy that posted on the discussion board that he was discouraged and felt stupid even though he has a PHD in Biology.  
        <br>
        <br>
        I just read through the Stage 2 project and I know I'm not going to be able to write the Phython code that is going to be acceptable becuase I still don't quite understand it.....
        <br>
        <br>
        The End.</div>
